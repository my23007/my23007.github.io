## Module 2 unit4 post

Security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems are becoming an issue as technology is evolving. Hence, security management has become a challenging task for organizations due to the rising complexity of information systems and the increasing presence and sophistication of attacks (Ekelhart et al. 2019). In this context, Logging plays an important role in both security analysis and the potential vulnerabilities related to log exploitation.  Chuvakin et al(2013) argue that logs can serve as a foundational element in detecting and investigating security incidents by providing a historical record of events. Furthermore, Miller (2015) mentions that detailed logs can help in post-incident forensics and compliance audits, contributing significantly to understanding security breaches and legal proceedings.

On the other hand, Berger(2023) highlights on log-related exploits in Log4j 2 library where adversaries can insert malicious code to download and execute harmful code from malicious sources. Moreover, Storing sensitive data in logs can expose organizations to risks. If logs are accessible to unauthorized users or contain sensitive information, prolonged retention increases the potential impact of breaches which can lead to deletion or altering of the files (Miller, 2015). Additionally, extensive logging can arguably impact system's performance causing high CPU load.

In conclusion, while logging is essential for security analysis, it can cause potential risks if mishandled or inadequately protected. Organizations must implement efficient log management practices to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of log data, thereby mitigating the risks associated with log-related exploits.
