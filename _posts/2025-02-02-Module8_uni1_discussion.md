## Module 8 unit1 collaborative discussion

I selected the "Abusive Workplace Behavior" (ACM, N.D.) because of its relevance among groups and teams.
The ACM case study on abusive workplace behavior highlights significant ethical breaches by a technical team leader, Max, whose actions contravene multiple principles of the ACM Code of Ethics. Max's verbal abuse towards team members, particularly Diane, not only caused harm but also failed to maintain a safe and respectful working environment, violating Principle 1.1, which emphasizes avoiding harm and contributing to society and human well-being. Additionally, his failure to give proper credit to team members by removing their names from journal submissions and preventing them from appearing on stage breaches Principle 1.5, which mandates honoring property rights, including intellectual property. Furthermore, Max's unprofessional communication style contravenes Principle 2.2, which calls for high standards of professional competence and conduct.

The British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct similarly outlines expectations for IT professionals to uphold public interest, integrity, and competence (BCS,2022). Max's behavior violates several key principles of the BCS Code:

Public Interest: The BCS Code states that members shall "have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment." (BCS, 2022: p. 2). Max's abusive actions compromise the well-being of his colleagues, thereby breaching this principle.

Professional Competence and Integrity: Members are expected to carry out professional responsibilities with due care and diligence in accordance with the relevant authority's requirements, and the interests of others (BCS,2022). Max's failure to credit his team members and his abusive behavior demonstrate a lack of integrity and diligence.

Duty to the Profession: The code requires members to "uphold the reputation and good standing of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT." (BCS, 2022: p. 3). Max's conduct damages the profession's reputation and undermines professional standards.

From a legal perspective, workplace abuse can lead to claims of harassment or a hostile work environment, depending on the jurisdiction. In many countries, laws protect employees from such behavior, and organizations can face legal consequences if they fail to address these issues. Socially, such behavior fosters a toxic work culture, leading to decreased morale, productivity, and increased turnover. Professionally, it undermines trust and collaboration within teams, which are essential for successful project outcomes.

Academic literature supports the detrimental effects of abusive supervision. For instance, Tepper (2000) found that employees who perceive their supervisors as abusive are more likely to experience job dissatisfaction, stress, and turnover intentions. Furthermore, research by Avey, Palanski, and Walumbwa (2011) indicates that ethical leadership is positively correlated with employee job performance and organizational citizenship behaviors, highlighting the importance of adhering to ethical codes.

In conclusion, Max's actions starkly violate both the ACM and BCS ethical codes, with significant legal, social, and professional repercussions. This case underscores the critical importance of ethical conduct in maintaining a healthy work environment and upholding the integrity of the computing profession.
