I chose Bank in UK.
# Threat Modeling Manifesto Principles:
1.	Understand the System: Thoroughly understand the architecture, components, and dependencies of the bank's systems.
2.	Identify Threats: Identify potential threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the bank's assets.
3.	Mitigate Risks: Develop and execute security measures to avoid the identified risks.
4.	Iterate: revise and update the threat model on a regular basis to familiarize to evolving threats and changes in the system.
# OWASP Threat Modeling Cookbook Approach:
1.	Define System Scope: Include all components of the bank's infrastructure, including networks, servers, applications, and data stores.
2.	Decompose the System: decompose the system under assessment into smaller components to understand their interactions and potential vulnerabilities.
3.	Categorize Assets: Classify critical assets such as financial transactions and client data
4.	Enumerate Threats: Consider threats such as unauthorized access, insider threats, data breaches, malware attacks, and denial of service.
5.	Rate Risks: Assess the likelihood and impact of each threat to prioritize mitigation efforts.
6.	Mitigation Strategies: Implement security procedures; for instance intrusion detection systems, access controls, encryption, and regular security assessments.
7.	Validate the Model: Test the effectiveness of the threat model through penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and red team exercises.
# MITRE ATT&CK Framework:
1.	Tactics and Techniques: understand common tactics and techniques used by adversaries, such as Credential Access or Privilege Escalation
2.	Adversary Behavior: Identify potential adversary behaviors such as credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
3.	Mapping to Controls: Map identified threats to relevant security controls and countermeasures.
4.	Detect and Respond: Develop detection and response capabilities to identify and mitigate adversarial activity.
