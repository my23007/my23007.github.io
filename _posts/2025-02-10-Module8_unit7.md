I did the analysis using R - below is the R program used


# R program

[Workspace loaded from ~/.RData]

> library(readxl)

> Exe_8_6C <- read_excel("C:/Users/myounes/Downloads/Exe 8.6C.xlsx")

> View(Exe_8_6C)

> library(readxl)

> library(data.table)

data.table 1.15.2 using 4 threads (see ?getDTthreads).  Latest news: r-datatable.com

Warning message:

package ‘data.table’ was built under R version 4.3.3 

> mydata = data.table(Exe_8_6C)

> head(mydata)

      Sex Income
   <char>  <num>

2:      M   54.6

3:      M   38.6

4:      M   58.2

5:      M   34.6

6:      M   42.9

> sample1 = mydata[Sex=="M"]

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  sample1$Income and sample2$Income

t = 3.2679, df = 116.8, p-value = 0.001423

alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0

95 percent confidence interval:

  3.419559 13.940441

sample estimates:

mean of x mean of y 

 52.91333  44.23333

# Comments on the results

Since the p-value is very small (p < 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This provides strong evidence that the mean income for males is significantly higher than that of females.
