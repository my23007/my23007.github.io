Reflection on Module2 – Security and risk management:
The Security and Risk Management course encompasses a broad array of critical concepts and methodologies essential for safeguarding organizations in today's dynamic threat landscape. Below are the highlights:
Unit1 began with discussing definitions of risk from the academic literature, then moved to highlighting various risk assessment standards such as FAIR and OCTAVE framework, this was important since it was the base of the first assignment which was submitted later in unit6. Unit1 also featured a discussion forum on Industry 4.0 which introduced new technologies such as AI, IOT. However, the adoption incorporated new threats, notably the increasing trend of vulnerability to cyber-attacks due to the increasing number of connected systems or devices (Cabaj et al,2018). Moreover, Digital technologies also pose transformative risks, necessitating new competencies and evaluation criteria for the workforce (Kazançoglu and Özkan Özen, 2018). Hence, it will be vital for organizations to effectively assess and address various risks to successfully implement industry 4.0 (Gadekar et al., 2021).

Unit2 main highlight was the article by Spears & Barki (2010) on the user participation in risk management process. The article emphasized on the user participation in information security risk assessment process and the impact with regards to regulatory compliance using a multi-method approach (Spears & Barki, 2010). My contribution is available under this link - https://my23007.github.io/seminar2/post/2024/02/27/Module3_seminar2-post.html
Unit 3 examined the basic principles of threat Management and described the various models used for threat Management. In this context, threat modeling involves systematically identifying potential threats to an organization's assets, understanding their capabilities and intentions, and assessing the likelihood and impact of these threats. It's a structured approach that helps organizations prioritize their security efforts effectively. From an academic standpoint, students can explore various threat modeling methods or frameworks such as STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege), which provides a systematic method for categorizing threats.
Unit4 was an interesting and important unit as it provided further guidance to students for assignment1 in unit6. In this unit, students explored several resources and tools which can be utilized in threat modelling and management, which will enable them in creating threat models based on mentioned scenarios. Moreover, students were requested to read Shostack (2018) to practice creating a threat models based on scenarios like international bank, airport or nuclear power station. This exercise was very useful and gave students the opportunity to dive into various models such as OWASP and MITRE ATT&CK Framework. My contribution is recorded in e-portfolio under this link - https://my23007.github.io/unit4/seminar/2024/03/13/Module3_unit4_seminar-post.html
Moving to unit5, this unit highlighted some of the industry specific security standards and directives and discussed how standards can impact security and risk assessments. Moreover, students were requested to explore data protection commission website and chose a case study to identify GDPR related issues and breaches (Data Protection Commission, 2020) . My chosen activity was related the hospital's disclosure of sensitive personal information or data to a third party. The highlights from this case is that organizations should train new employees on GDPR standards as part of the onboarding process to ensure proper alignment to GDR and compliance with its regulations. My activity is available in e-portfolio under this link - https://my23007.github.io/unit5/gdpr/case/study/2024/03/13/Module3_unit5_GDPR-post.html
Unit6 was an important unit since it contained the first milestone and evaluation in this module. Moreover, it was the first occurrence that students were requested to work on the assignment in groups. I was lucky to be part of a highly motivated group and enjoyed working with all my peers. I had the chance to apply my skills I gained in my previous MBA program like team roles, motivation in groups, effective communication and time management. In this context, I initiated a group chat to be able to communicate easily. Moreover, I conducted several meetings with my peers and we had our final meeting to finalize the group assignment. Everyone provided his comments and we agreed on the final version for submission. I learned how to construct Gantt charts on a technical level and coordination on team level.
Unit7 set the base for the second assignment as this unit explored various methods that can be utilized as part of quantitative risk modelling. These encompass probabilistic approaches such as Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, students were requested to read Spring et al (2021) and reflect on author's critique to CVSS method. Spring et al (2021) criticized the current version of CVSS and argued that it’s not justifiable to be utilized as a risk assessment method. They suggested that the scoring formula should be redone to reflect the needed risk elements of context and material consequences. The summary is available in e-portfolio under this link - https://my23007.github.io/unit9/summary/post/2024/03/17/Module3_unit9-summary_post.html
Unit8 discussed the implementation of Quantitative Risk Models and encompassed a seminar activity in which students were requested to read several articles by Goerlandt et al (2017), Hugo et al (2018) and Çelikbilek & Tüysüz (2020) and answer specific questions, the answers are included in the e-portfolio under below link - https://my23007.github.io/module/3/unit8/seminar/post/2024/03/28/Module3_unit8_seminar-post.html
However, I faced issues in the other part of the assignment where I installed the needed macro required for the excel sheet, but I was still facing the same error when running the simulation "run time error subscript out of range"
Unit9 highlighted topics such as Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery which was also important since this was part of the second assignment. Furthermore, the unit discussed different disaster recovery strategies based on the recovery time objective and recovery point objective. The less those metrics were, the more cost the solution will be.
Unit10 was an important one as it described the impact of recovery time objective and recovery point objective values on disaster recovery solutions. Moreover, the unit highlighted the design of such solution to meet RTO and RPO requirements, which was part of assignment2. Furthermore, unit10 included a seminar exercise in which students were requested to read Opara-Martins et al (2014) and Morrow et al (2021) in order to answer related questions, in addition to creating high-level charts for disaster recovery solutions that meet certain requirements, my contribution is recorded in e-portfolio under below link - https://my23007.github.io/module/3/unit10/seminar/post/2024/03/28/Module3_unit10_seminar-post.html
Unit11 contained another important milestone for assignment2 submission. In this context, applying quantitative risk assessment was challenging to me in the beginning as it was a required task in assignment2, the lecture cast didn’t provide a clear indication how it was carried out neither the e-book. I had to watch online YouTube videos on Monte Carlo simulation to learn how it was carried out using Microsoft Excel. Moreover, I read about the PERT method and applied it in assignment2 to calculate the probabilities. This was my first time to use Monte Carlo simulation and it was a good learning. However, I feel it would be more appropriate to include a simple example in the lecture cast explaining how Monte Carlo simulation or other method could be implemented. The lecture cast was not clear to me and I had to do the extra mile to enhance my knowledge on quantitative assessment. Moreover, I learned how to create branches on GitHub with the help of YouTube as well, the steps I did for branch creation will be highlighted in Appendix A.
And finally, unit12 encompassed a debate about the future of security risk management and highlighted some of the future trends in the domain of security and risk, such as the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to security and risk.
Overall, the security and risk management module has been an enlightening journey, providing insights into the complex landscape of safeguarding assets, mitigating threats, and managing vulnerabilities in various contexts. It has been a challenging journey to manage between work, studies, family and Ramadan fasting, but with proper time management I was able to explore and learn about security and risk assessment. Throughout the course, we delved into fundamental concepts and reading material that underpin effective security assessments and disaster recovery. One of the key takeaways from the module was the comprehensive understanding of risk assessment methodologies. We explored various frameworks such as OCTAVE (which was used in the assignment) and NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which helped in systematically identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks. Understanding threat modeling involves not only technical aspects but also requires insights into organizational context, business objectives, and threat intelligence. Moreover, quantitative risk assessment involves assigning numerical values to different aspects of risk, such as likelihood and impact, to facilitate objective decision-making. In academia, students and researchers delve into probabilistic models, statistical analysis, and mathematical techniques to quantify risks accurately. They learn to calculate risk scores, prioritize risks, and allocate resources based on risk exposure. However, I made assumptions in my assignment to ease my analysis. This could be potentially an interesting topic to explore and enhance our knowledge during this master’s program. Furthermore, Disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity planning (BCP) are vibrant components of organizational resilience, ensuring the ability to respond to and recover from disruptions.
However, it's essential to acknowledge the inherent limitations and challenges within security and risk management practices. One notable critique revolves around the ethical considerations in surveillance and data privacy, especially in the context of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and biometrics. Balancing security imperatives with individual rights and freedoms remains a pressing concern that warrants further exploration and debate.
On a personal level, this module has expanded my perspective on security beyond the conventional notion of physical barriers and alarms. It has equipped me with the analytical tools and critical thinking skills necessary to assess risks comprehensively and develop holistic security assessments. Moreover, the group assignment fostered teamwork and communication skills, essential for effective security management in professional settings.
Looking ahead, the knowledge gained from this module will undoubtedly inform my academic pursuits and professional endeavors. As security threats continue to evolve in complexity and scale, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in security and risk management practices. I intend to further explore areas such as cyber threat intelligence and resilience planning to stay abreast of emerging trends and contribute meaningfully to the field. I am interested in ML and AI contribution in security and risk assessment; for example, how AI can be used to automate security related tasks such as incident response, threat detection. In addition, how ML algorithms can be utilized to assign risk scores to various assets, systems, or processes based on factors such as their importance to the organization, historical security incidents, and current vulnerabilities. This benefits companies in prioritizing security efforts and assigning resources in a more efficient manner. On the other hand, incorporating ML and AI into security and risk assessment processes requires careful consideration of factors such as data quality, model accuracy, and ethical considerations to ensure effective and responsible use of these technologies. Additionally, ongoing monitoring and evaluation are essential to ensure that ML models remain effective in addressing evolving security threats and risks.
In conclusion, the Security and Risk Management module has been a transformative experience, deepening my understanding of the multifaceted challenges inherent in safeguarding assets and mitigating threats. By embracing a proactive and adaptive approach to security, we can navigate the dynamic landscape of risk with resilience and vigilance.
